## Background Context

This project aims to familiarize you with different sorting algorithms and the concept of Big O notation. Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science as they allow us to efficiently organize data. Big O notation provides a way to analyze and compare the efficiency of different algorithms based on their time complexity.

To enhance your understanding, you can refer to the provided resources on sorting algorithms, Big O notation, sorting algorithm animations, and their visualizations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Implement at least four different sorting algorithms.
- Explain the concept of Big O notation and evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
- Select the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
- Understand what a stable sorting algorithm is.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- Include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
- Follow the Betty style. Run `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` to check your code.
- Do not use global variables.
- Each function should not exceed 25 lines of code.
- Do not use the standard library functions unless specified.
- The prototypes of all functions should be included in the `sort.h` header file.
- Push the `sort.h` header file.
- Use include guards in all header files.
- A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.

## Sorting Algorithms

Implement at least four different sorting algorithms in separate files. Choose from the following algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Merge Sort
6. Counting Sort
7. Radix Sort
8. Shell Sort
9. Heap Sort
10. Cocktail Shaker Sort
11. Bucket Sort

Feel free to add any additional sorting algorithms you may find interesting.

## Big O Notation

In the project, you should demonstrate an understanding of Big O notation by evaluating the time complexity of each implemented sorting algorithm. Provide a brief explanation of the time complexity of each algorithm and compare their efficiency.

## How to Use

To use the sorting algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/sorting_algorithms.git
   ```

2. Change the current directory to the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd sorting_algorithms
   ```

3. Compile the C files:

   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o sort
   ```

4. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./sort
   ```

5. Follow the instructions on the screen to test different sorting algorithms and visualize their output.
